Imagine you are a Data Scientist at Fitbit

You've been given a user data to analyse and find some insights which can be shown on the smart watch.


But why would we want to analyse the user data for desiging the watch?

These insights from the user data can help business make customer oriented decision for the product design.


Let's first look at the data we have gathered.

Notice that our data is structured in a tabular format.

Each column is known as a feature.
Each row is known as a record.
Basic EDA
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is like being a detective for numbers and information.

Imagine you have a big box of colorful candies. EDA is like looking at all the candies, counting how many of each color there are, and maybe even making a pretty picture to show which colors you have the most of. This way, you can learn a lot about your candies without eating them all at once!

So, EDA is about looking at your things, which is data in this case, to understand them better and find out interesting stuff about them.

Formally defining, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process of examining, summarizing, and visualizing data sets to understand their main characteristics, uncover patterns that helps analysts and data scientists gain insights into the data, make informed decisions, and guide further analysis or modeling.
